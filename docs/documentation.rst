Documentation
=============

Pyvroom tries to align its functionality close to `VROOM
<https://github.com/VROOM-Project/vroom>`_. Please see `VROOM API documentation
<https://github.com/VROOM-Project/vroom/blob/master/docs/API.md>`_ for an
overview of what VROOM is capable of.

For pragmatic reasons tiny differences might exist here and there. For that
reason, use the following reference documentation.
